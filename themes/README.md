# Themes

If you are interested in creating a theme, all you have to do is submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Lovely-Experiences/FileView.php/pulls) with your modified version of `fvcontents`.

Please make sure the following...

-   That your folder's name is the same name as the theme.
-   That the pull request is only modifying your theme, nothing else.
-   Make sure your folder is in the `themes/` folder.

You should include a `README.md` in your folder that specifies some information about it, as well as what version of FileView.php it's intended for.
